# 1. What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.
Need to add topics, and join tables. 
topics table: stores the topics 
lesson_topics table: join table that connects the topics and lessons in many-to-many relationship

# 2. What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on?
topics table: id (PK), name (string, name of topic)
lesson_topics table: id (PK), lesson_id (foreign key, reference to lessons table), topic_id (foreign key, reference to topics table)

# 3. What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?

# I don't think any other are required.

# 4. Write out each table's name and column names with data types.
topics: id (integer, primary key), name (string, unique, required)
lesson_topics: id (integer, primary key), lesson_id (integer, foreign key, reference to lessons table), topic_id (integer, foreign key, reference to topics table)

# 5. Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file and run the command to generate the empty migration file. Start with just the topics migration. (Hint: your filename should be create_topics)

bin/rails generate migration create_topics name:string

# 6. Inside the create_table block in the migration file, add the appropriate columns and datatypes.

# 7. Run the migration with bin/rails db:migrate (in a terminal window, not a rails console). Watch the output and make sure it is successful before moving on. (You can check the database to see if your table exists.)

# 8. Add the Topic model before moving on.

# 9. Now determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file for the join table. Don't forget that it should begin with create_ and be followed by the table name.

bin/rails generate migration create_lesson_topics lesson:references topic:references

# 10. Inside the create_table block, add associations to topics and lessons with t.references :topic and t.references :lesson

# 11. Run the migration.

# 12. If the migration run was successful, create the model for your join table (be sure the name matches Rails conventions).

# 13. Open the console and test your new models by creating the topics above and adding them to some lessons.
